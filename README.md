### Requirements

You will need to [install MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) and have an environment set up to run Javascript applications.

### Getting Started

If you have met the requirements, you ought to be able to clone the git repository, and from the root folder run:
```
npm install
npm run build
(optionally) npm run seed
npm run start
```
Then launch your API app, like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), and connect to http://localhost:3001

### Tips

The userRoutes.ts and thoughtsRoutes.ts files should give you an idea on what API calls are available.
Look in the models folder for an idea on what information is needed in the body of POST and PUT calls.
